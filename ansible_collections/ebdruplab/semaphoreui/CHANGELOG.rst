Version 2.0.1
-------------

**Fetures, fixes and documentation**

- Adding new feature to the ``project_deploy`` role.
  - Added and reworked the role to be able to handle ``project_deploy_force_project_update``.
  - It will then update ``projects``, ``templates``, ``keys``, ``schedules``, ``integrations``, ``users_access``, ``inventories``, ``views``, ``environments`` and ``repositories``.

- **plugins/modules/project_integration_update.py**
  - Accepts both UI labels and slugs for auth_method (e.g., Token and token, HMAC and hmac).
  - Normalizes to API slugs and applies smart defaults for auth_header:
    - token → token
    - hmac → X-Hub-Signature-256
  - Resolves the error: “value of auth_method must be one of … got: token” when playbooks pass the slug.

- **plugins/modules/project_integration_create.py**
  - Documentation/examples clarified that labels and slugs are accepted.
  - Default header logic documented; task_params.environment is JSON-encoded when a dict/list is provided.

- **plugins/modules/project_template_update.py**
  - Rewrote DOCUMENTATION to satisfy ansible-doc (no nested mappings in a description list item; every (sub-)option has a description).
  - Added complete EXAMPLES.
  - Normalizes tags / skip_tags (list or string → newline-separated string).
  - Accepts task_params.tags, task_params.skip_tags, task_params.limit as string or list.
  - Maps common aliases (camelCase & legacy) to canonical fields.
  - Drops task_params and survey_vars for job templates (API quirk) to avoid 400s.

- **plugins/modules/semaphore_template_create.py**
  - Documentation aligned with the original example style while fixing invalid/missing bits to pass ansible-doc.
  - Fix: tags / skip_tags normalization; applies prompt_* via follow-up PUT (includes app and type to avoid “Invalid app id”).
  - Create fallbacks for job templates that reject task_params.allow_debug.

- **plugins/modules/project_repository_update.py**
  - Added missing description on all options/suboptions/returns to resolve:
    - “All (sub-)options and return values must have a 'description' field.”

Module Added
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **user_password_update.py**  
  Added so we are able to update user's password using Ansible.

- **project_key_update.py**  
  Added so we are able to update keys using Ansible.

- **project_view_update.py**  
  Added a way to update views using Ansible.

Module update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **plugins/modules/project_integration_update.py**  
  Fixed the documentation and fixed problems with updating integrations as there where a missing key.

- **project_backup.py**
  - ``plugins/modules/project_backup.py``: Hardened response handling
    - Now accepts ``bytes``, ``str``, or already-decoded ``dict`` from ``semaphore_get`` and normalizes to a Python ``dict``.
  - ``plugins/modules/project_backup.py``: Improved error messages
    - On non-200 responses, includes HTTP status **and** a readable response body (decodes bytes / dumps dicts) to aid debugging.
  - ``plugins/modules/project_backup.py``: Return metadata
    - Explicitly returns ``changed: false`` (read-only GET) and ``status`` (HTTP status code).
  - ``plugins/modules/project_backup.py``: Header cleanup
    - Removed unnecessary ``Content-Type: application/json`` header on GET requests.
  - ``plugins/modules/project_backup.py``: Robust URL construction
    - Uses ``host.rstrip("/")`` and passes named parameters (``url``, ``headers``, ``validate_certs``) to ``semaphore_get``.
  - ``plugins/modules/project_backup.py``: Documentation polish
    - Clarified endpoint path (``GET /api/project/{project_id}/backup``), examples include schedules discovery, and documented new return fields.

Role
----
- **roles/project_deploy**
  - Integration tasks now tolerate label/slug inputs and resolve template_id from either explicit template_id, template_name, or newly created templates.
  - Additional facts/maps and optional debug output to make schedule/integration resolution visible.
  - (Docs) Provided schedule management snippets clarifying create/update/prune flow.
